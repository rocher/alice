## Alice / Advent of Code TODO List

### Short term

   * Use Cases:
     * Example input found in problems description must be added as a test
       case, so that users can check their own solution with it.
       * A test case consists in a pair of input file + expected result.
     * Users can share their own input file and solution as a new test case for
       a given puzzle.
     * Users can provide a solution and check it with all shared test cases.
   * [ ] Add support for puzzles based on [Project Euler
     CLI](../project_euler/src/cli/), so that users can check their
     implementation.
   * [ ] Add support for downloading input files and solutions (if
     available).
