# Alice

> *Adventures for Learning and Inspiring Coding Excellence*

## Presentation

Alice is an open source Ada programming language framework designed to help
programmers implement and explore different solutions to problems from
various sources, including [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net),
[Codingame](https://codingame.com) and [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com) (currently, only support for Project Euler is
present in Alice). With Alice, you can flex your coding muscles and work on
problems that challenge your creativity, logic, and problem-solving skills.

At the heart of Alice is a commitment to coding excellence, and Ada is the
perfect language to bring this vision to life. As a high-level programming
language designed for safety, reliability, and efficiency, Ada provides a
powerful and flexible toolset for programmers to create robust and scalable
software solutions. With Ada, you can write clean, concise, and elegant code
that is easy to read and maintain, helping to ensure that your programs are
error-free and performant. So whether you're a seasoned Ada programmer or new
to the language, Alice is the perfect platform to hone your skills and push
your limits.

## Collaboration

With Alice, you can collaborate in a variety of ways:

   * Implementing new solutions to challenging problems: there are +800
     problems in Project Euler!
      * Improve existing algorithms.
      * Implement new algorithms.
      * Use parallelism to explore the search space using multiple tasks.
      * Share and export common functionality as new elements in the [Euler
        Tools](https://github.com/rocher/euler_tools) library.
      * Create awesome visualizations to problem solutions.
      * Explore algorithm behavior of problem solutions by adding new
        parameters.

   * Developing new graphical interfaces using your preferred GUI library:
     GTK, SDL, SFML or LVGL, to mention some of them.

   * Refactor and improve the Alice framework itself to inspire new concepts
     towards coding excellence.

   * Start the development and integration of other problem sources: take a
     look at what's planned for [Codigame](codingame/TODO.md) and [Advent of
     Code](advent_of_code/TODO.md).

   * Integrate new sources of problems or challenges, learning sites or
     references. For example, would make sense to have Rosetta Code somehow
     integrated in Alice?

   * Check the [TODO](TODO.md) for more ideas.

Alice is still in the early stages of development, and things are likely to
change as we continue to refine and improve the framework. While Alice is
still a work in progress, it is already starting to take shape as a robust
and usable tool for exploring the challenges of the aforementioned _Problem
Sources_. For example, to solve a Project Euler problem, there are two
interfaces you can implement: CLI, a basic Command Line Interface; and GUI, a
generic Graphical User Interface to create visual representations. Take a
look at some of the provided examples.
